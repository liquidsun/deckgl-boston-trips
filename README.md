This is an example of the [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/#/examples/core-layers/trips-layer) trips layer for Boston BLue Bikes. 
The application is written by [github.com/stevekirks](https://github.com/stevekirks/deckgl-trips)
with a few amendments from my side.  
The source data - [Bluebikes history data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/index.html) for October 2019.  

Trips routes are calculated using [Graphhopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) routing engine.

To run the application use the content of build folder and put it to a webserver.
